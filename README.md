# Immo Coin -- Front-end application

## About

### The app

ImmoCoin is a platform built with React and Rails where authenticated users can publish real estate classified ads. Only authenticated users can see contact details for an ad. Visitors and authenticated users can see the ads and search an ad by location. Authenticated users can create an ad and manage their published ads through a dashboard (edit the ad description and location, add pictures, delete the ad). Find the app in production on Heroku [here](https://thp-immo-proj.herokuapp.com/)!

### Technical specs

This Next.js app relies on a Ruby on Rails back-end API server available [here](https://github.com/Caro407/THP_IMMO_PROJ_BACK). It was built with Next 10.2 and React 17.0.

It uses Redux and the js-cookie module for global state management. Styles use the Tailwind CSS library. 

## How to run locally

After cloning this repository (or downloading and unzipping it), run `npm install` in the CLI to install necessary modules, and `npm run dev` to start the server on local port 3005.
